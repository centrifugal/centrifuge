// Disconnect allows configuring how client will be disconnected from a server.
// A server can provide a Disconnect.Code and Disconnect.Reason to a client. Clients
// can execute some custom logic based on a certain Disconnect.Code. Code is also
// used for metric collection. Disconnect.Reason is optional and exists mostly for
// human-readable description of returned code â€“ i.e. for logging, debugging etc.
//
// The important note is that Disconnect.Reason must be less than 127 bytes
// due to WebSocket protocol limitations.
//
// Codes have some rules which should be followed by a client connector implementation.
// These rules described below.
//
// Codes in range 0-2999 should not be used by a Centrifuge library user. Those are
// reserved for the client-side and transport specific needs. Codes in range >=5000
// should not be used also. Those are reserved by Centrifuge.
//
// Client should reconnect upon receiving code in range 3000-3499, 4000-4499, >=5000.
// For codes <3000 reconnect behavior can be adjusted for specific transport.
//
// Codes in range 3500-3999 and 4500-4999 are application terminal codes, no automatic
// reconnect should be made by a client implementation.
//
// Library users supposed to use codes in range 4000-4999 for creating custom
// disconnects.
