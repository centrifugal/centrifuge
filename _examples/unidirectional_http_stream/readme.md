Example demonstrates a possibility of using Centrifuge with Fetch Readable Stream unidirectional transport (HTTP-streaming). Should work [in most major browsers](https://caniuse.com/streams) - though only tested in Chrome and Firefox at the moment..

To start example run the following command from example directory:

```
go run main.go
```

Then go to http://localhost:8000 to see it in action.
