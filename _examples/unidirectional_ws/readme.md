Example demonstrates a possibility of using Centrifuge with WebSocket unidirectional transport. This can make sense if you build a system based on unidirectional data flow so websocket is just a one more viable option to connect for your clients.

To start example run the following command from example directory:

```
go run main.go
```

Then go to http://localhost:8000 to see it in action.
